# Simple Diffusion
This project works through parts the tutorial material from [A Beginner's Friendly Introduction to Diffusion Models in JAX](https://axeldonath.com/jax-diffusion-models-pydata-boston-2025/) by Axel Donath, presented at PyData Boston 2025.  The notebook `diffusion_demo.ipynb` just works through parts in parallel and should be runnable on a CPU.  You will need to follow along with the original blog post to get the 'sound track'.
